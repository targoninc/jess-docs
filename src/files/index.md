# Jess Documentation

Jess is a framework to make templating and state management on web platforms easier.

## Getting started

```bash
bun install @targoninc/jess
```

As a first read, you should become familiar with [templating](/?page=Templating/index.md) and [signals](/?page=Signals/index.md).

## Components

There are pre-built [components]() available for you to use. They provide an abstraction for the basic component needs.
